Loop iterates when: NewMsg (Skip or Poll), Timeout expired
    1. Poll: send message and sleep again to date as before
    2. Skip: Check if we are in range to skip
        a) No => got to sleep again
        b) Yes => Sleep until day after MÃ¼ll
    3. Timeout: Evaluate if we are really over sleep time
        a) No => go to sleep again
        b) Yes => Check if we are after 9:00
            i) No: advance next reminder Time:
                A. 12:00 -> 18:00
                B. else: -> +2h
            ii) Extract next dates and adjust sleep timeout
